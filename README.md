# BreakNot

A simple program used to notify me that I have to get up from my desk every two hours of work
in order to prevent eye strain and back pain.

# Build

Run `build.bat` in order to build using pipenv.

# Notice

My first python attempt so it is probably written badly and does not follow the python best practices.
Any help and advice is welcome.
